## Tension and distension

Brain could focus for X amount of time; then, it needs some rest (something you enjoy that could be done unconscious). There are several ways of doing this. We use, in different moments, one of these:

- 55' focus / 15' break
- 25' focus / 5' break

**Be 5' flexible** because there are times you'll need to finish that task or relax a bit more but not more because you need energy for the future and over concentration will lead to exhaustion. And obviously, experiment and find your own!

## Before focus

### 1. Forget

- [ ] 1. ...what you know. Invoke **beginners mind** and your **guts**
- [ ] 2. ...what is **not urgent** for your next objective
- [ ] 3. ...what you can't

### 2. Act

- [ ] 1. Do this as sport: involve phisically
- [ ] 2. Research, ask and take notes as you would teach about this

### 3. State

- [ ] 1. How are you seated? How are you standing? Take care of your **posture**
- [ ] 2. How are you breathing? Relax your pelvis, breath there and exhale relaxing your shoulders. Repeat circularly until ready: **confortly active**
- [ ] 3. Be prepared to forget what is not urgent for your next objective as soon is it pops

## During focus

### 4. Ask

- [ ] 1. How will I use this?
- [ ] 2. Why will I use this?
- [ ] 3. When will I use this?
- [ ] 4. Am I asking good questions?

### 5. Remember you'll teach this

- [ ] 1. Do whatever you need to explain in the future
- [ ] 2. Explain the process as you go

### 6. if frustration appears ( :pensive: )

- [ ] 1. **Distinguish** the **critical** inner voice
- [ ] 2. Create a bizarre, ugly and fun character and **transfer that voice** to them
- [ ] 3. Show **evidence** to him/her to shut him/her up
- [ ] 4. What could you learn from this? Transform that critic in some positive thought, **learning oportunity**
- [ ] 5. Remember **people who inspires** you. Ask what inspired me about him/her
- [ ] 6. Walk, code or do the minimum next step and **enjoy with you and others** of this awesome opportunity to live! :muscle: :smile: :heart:

### 7. Before ending focus and going to break

- [ ] 1. **decide** what you should do next
- [ ] 2. open search and **find 'continue's** clauses
- [ ] 3. **delete** them
- [ ] 4. establish your **new continues**
  - [ ] a. use comment to get fancy colors: **//TODO**
  - [ ] b. **append 'continue'** if with just that one will be enough or use numbers to show a flow 'continue1', 'continue2', etc
  - [ ] c. go for a **break**

## Break time

Feel free to add more!

- [ ] a. Seat or lie down, breath calmly and watch your breath. Let your mind wonders
- [ ] b. Play something away from a screen
- [ ] c. Move your body, do some yoga, dance
- [ ] d. Play some instrument
- [ ] e. Fix something
- [ ] f. Do your bed
- [ ] g. accomodate the house
