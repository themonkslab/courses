- [ ] 1. use [Conventional commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/)
  - [ ] a. header based on branch.
  - [ ] b. naming
    - [ ] appends a **! after the type/scope**, introduces a **breaking API** change => **major** in semantic versioning.
    - [ ] use **# automated reference** to epic tickets
    - [ ] final **form**: type-of-branch(name-of-branch-#number-of-epic)exclamation-if-braking-change: #number-of-ticket responde-to-this-commit-will-add...
